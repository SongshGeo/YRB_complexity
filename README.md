# Complexity emergence in the YRB

## Introduction

This is a repository for complexity analysis in the YRB, China.

Complexity, especially economic complexity, is a integrated indicator for development. Here, we assume that water use in a large river basin (mainly for economic development) also has a similar mechanism throughout its develping. 

- At first, water uses were mainly contributed to its volume rather than structure. As results, resources were allocated into the primal industry (i.e., agriculture) in an extensive way (i.e., with low efficiency). 
- After then, with more complex industries, develping water limit can be easily reached and competetions in water use are widespread therefore. 
- Finally, as a main constraint, water should be fully considered at a basin scale. For comparative advantage in water competition, complexity emerge in their water uses, which means more intensive primary industry (with higher water use effciency) and more complex water use advanced industry. 

## Complexity index

Here we use an index to indicate complexity changes in the YRB.
